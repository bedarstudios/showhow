[2026-10-18] DECISION: Use ~/dev/loop-evidence/HANDOFF-INDEX.md as the authorised Showhow handoff index, and reconcile the project note through a documentation PR before dispatching #118. | REASONING: Owner approved the concrete index path and docs route; #117 close-out had no configured index. | CONTEXT: Verified #117 issue handoff and index entry; owner merged docs PR #131, then #118 was dispatched.
[2026-10-18] DECISION: Monitor #118 through a ready-to-ship PR and use recommended fixes for routine questions within its approved scope; do not merge on agent authority. | REASONING: Owner explicitly requested sustained coordination through /goal. | CONTEXT: First review found an incorrectly excluded recording tray image; repaired within scope, then fresh Standards and Requirements PASS and all 11 CI checks passed. Owner merged PR #132 as 573d9f2c8fea9855b6f0ab9cdd47aabdb49c8db0. #128 remains deferred; no release tag was created.
